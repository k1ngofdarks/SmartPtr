Smart Pointer Implementation in C++

This project contains implementations of custom smart pointers in C++, including:

Intrusive Pointer: Efficient reference counting with objects that embed their own reference counter.

Shared Pointer: Standard shared ownership smart pointer.

Weak Pointer: Non-owning smart pointer used to break reference cycles.

Features

Lightweight and efficient management of dynamic memory.

Customizable behavior for specific use cases.

Compliant with modern C++ standards.

Usage

Include the corresponding header files and utilize the smart pointers as required in your project.

Feel free to explore, use, or modify the code to suit your needs!
